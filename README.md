# Adventure

This is a Java program that implements a text-based adventure game.

The game has several locations that the player can visit, such as a town gate, a crossroad, a river, a forest, and a place where the player encounters a dragon. Each location presents different choices to the player, and the player must make decisions that affect their character's health and items.
You can play the game on the console window.

You select your action by typing a number. You have HP and you can get a weapon during your adventure.
